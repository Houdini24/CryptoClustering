# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge
## Overview
In this challenge, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. I used the StandardScaler module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from a CSV file.

The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame appeared as follows:

## Analysis

1. What is the best value for k?

2. What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

3. What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
   
4. Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

5. What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
